Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

My class represents someone hosting a Boardgame night. When someone hosts a boardgame night, there are many factors to consider. For example, how many, what kinds, etc. of boardgames they have or if a guest shows up and needs to be added to the number of total players for the event. I did not implement any other classes alongside those listed in the interface. 

Looking at past assignments really worked for me again. I am also getting better at knowing how to google things properly. I've realized that this only really work for specific questions where I can use precise terminology. What did not work was trying to get too complicated with what I wanted to accomplish from the beginning. It ended up being very discouraging, so I would definetly not recommend doing that in the future. For someone taking thisin the future, I would recommend reaching out for help early on and to keep every coding sample you have because you never know what might be useful in the future.
